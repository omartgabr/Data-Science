# Exploring IMBD Movies

This project uses a dataset extracted from the IMDB website, and incorporates various techniques for data analysis and visualization in order to tell a story about the performance of a large number of movies.

Through this project, you will be able to gain insights into different aspects of movie performance such as box office revenues, ratings, and genres. However, please note that this project does have its own limitations and there may be some problems that were not addressed at the time of its creation.

Nevertheless, I hope that this project helps you to learn from and reflect on some common mistakes in data analysis. Feel free to explore the project and let me know your thoughts!
