# Dow Jones Index Dividend Yield Predictor

This project uses the Dow Jones Index dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository to gain insights and make predictions about the stock market.

The project includes initial hypotheses, exploratory data analysis, statistical tests, machine learning model development and evaluation. Specifically, I use a decision tree regressor model to predict dividend yields based on features such as open-high-low-close-volume (OHLCV) data.

The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the stock market and the factors that affect it. I hope this project can serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in the stock market or machine learning.
